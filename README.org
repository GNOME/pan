This is Pan, a powerful and user-friendly Usenet newsreader for GTK.

[[http://pan.rebelbase.com/][Pan website]].

** THE SALES PITCH

Pan is good for Reading News.

- Pan is the only Unix newsreader to score 100% on the Good
  Net-Keeping Seal of Approval newsreader evaluations.
- Pan has keyboard bindings for mouse-free newsreading.
- Basic newsreader features, such as reading and writing news,
  threading articles, and replying via email, are supported.
- Articles can be sorted by author, date, subject, or the number of
  unread children in the thread.
- Multiple connections are supported, so articles can be read while
  binaries are downloading.
- Articles can be filtered by regular expression matching, read/unread
  state, binary/text, etc.
- Works well as an offline reader.
- Articles can be queued until you want to go online, and can be
  re-edited at any point before they're posted.
- A flexible rules system allows you to delete, hide, download, or
  notify you of, etc. articles that match a subject, or are posted by
  a particular user, and so on.
- The same system can be used to define automatic actions on behalf of
  the user: auto-download, auto-cache, auto-delete etc.
- Groups can be filtered by regular expression matching
  subscribed/new/all, etc.

Pan is good at Binaries.

- Attached images can be shown inline.
- Pan can download and thread articles as quickly as bandwidth allows.
- uuencode, MIME, and yEnc attachments are all supported.
- A task manager lets you reorder, cancel, and resubmit download tasks.
- Multiple connections are supported, so many binaries can
  be downloaded simultaneously.
- Multipart articles are automatically grouped together.
- Non-binary, incomplete multipart, and saved messages can be filtered
  out of the article list.
- Files can be attached to a Usenet article and are
  automatically encrypted with yEnc, threaded and referenced by Pan.
- Articles can be encrypted or signed with a public or private PGP key
  for enhanced privacy and security.
- Connections can be encrypted with the TLS protocol.

** RELEASE NOTES

- You are advised to back up your $PAN_HOME directory (by default,
  =$HOME/.pan2=) before upgrading Pan.
- If you have previously been using a localhost server with stunnel and
  you now want to connect directly to a news server using the actual
  server address, do not create a new configuration entry for the
  server. Pan treats a new entry as a new server and does not preserve
  existing data on your subscribed groups, even though you are
  connecting to the very same server as before. Always edit the existing
  server configuration to preserve your subscriptions.
- Directories to search for SSL certificates can be defined with
  environment variables 'SSL_CERT_DIR' or 'SSL_DIR'.
- To use password storage provided by GNOME Keyring or libsecret, build
  Pan with support for that feature, and then enable it in Edit ->
  Preferences -> Miscellaneous -> 'Save passwords in password storage'.
