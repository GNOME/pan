* Getting Started
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: getting-started
:CLASS: title
:END:

This section provides information on how to start Pan, and describes the
Pan user interface.

** To Start Pan
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: to-start-pan
:CLASS: title
:END:

How to start Pan depends on your desktop environment.

- The GNOME Desktop Environment :: Press the Super key to enter the
  Activities Overview, type pan, and then press Enter.

- Command line :: To start Pan from a command line, type the following
  command, then press Enter:

  #+begin_src contents
  pan
  #+end_src

** When You Start Pan
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: when-you-start-pan
:CLASS: title
:END:

When you start Pan, the following window is displayed:

[[./mainwindow.png]]

The main Pan window contains the following elements:

- Menubar :: The menubar contains all the commands that you need to run
  Pan.
- Toolbar :: The toolbar contains a subset of the commands that you can
  access from the menubar. It also contains two textboxes that allow you
  to limit the number of groups and/or the number of articles displayed.
- Group Pane :: The Group Pane displays a list of all the newsgroups
  available on the server. This list is split into two groups:
  Subscribed Groups are a user-selected list of favorite groups, Other
  Groups are the rest of the available groups from the server.
- Header Pane :: The Header Pane displays a list of all the individual
  article headers available in the selected group. The Header Pane is
  highly customizable via sorting, threading and scoring.
- Body Pane :: The Body Pane displays the text of the selected article
  header.
- Status Bar :: The Status Bar displays information about current Pan
  activity:
  - Current number of connections to the server
  - Number of uncompleted tasks in the Task Manager
  - Completed percentage of current tasks
  - Error status of the event log

When you right-click in the Pan window, the application displays a popup
menu. The popup menu contains the most common commands for whichever
pane you clicked.

Like other applications, actions in Pan can be performed in several
ways: with the menu, with the toolbar or with shortcut keys. The
shortcut key for most menu items is shown in the menu itself, following
the menu command.

* Usenet in a Nutshell
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usenet-in-a-nutshell
:CLASS: title
:END:

Knowledge about how Usenet works will make using Pan easier.

** Description
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: description
:CLASS: title
:END:

Usenet is a distributed discussion system. Using a special program
called a newsreader, a user accesses a news server to read and post
email-like messages called articles. These articles are then exchanged
back and forth with other news servers throughout the world. In this
way, articles propagate from one news server to another throughout the
entire Usenet system.

** Organization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: organization
:CLASS: title
:END:

Articles are organized into categories called groups. In discussion
groups, most articles are responses to another article. The set of
articles which can be traced to one single non-reply article is called a
thread. When articles are organized into threads, it is much easier to
follow a single discussion.

** Article Headers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: article-headers
:CLASS: title
:END:

Articles are routed around Usenet based on the information contained in
the article header, which is the first part of an article that contains
information like the subject, author, date and routing information. To
save time and bandwidth, most newsreaders first download just the
article headers to sort and thread them. The user selects an article of
interest from the list of headers and then downloads the article body to
read.

** Binary Data
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: binary-data
:CLASS: title
:END:

Usenet was originally created to distribute text content encoded in
7-bit ASCII. With additional encoding programs, multiple posts per chunk
and other various tricks, it became possible to send binary data through
Usenet. Groups that allow for binary content or binaries are called
binary groups.

* Basic Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: basic-usage
:CLASS: title
:END:

This section is an overview on how to perform basic Usenet actions with
Pan.

** Set Up a News Server
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: set-up-a-news-server
:CLASS: title
:END:

When you start Pan for the first time, the Add a Server dialog is
displayed.

At this point, you must enter the connection information for the server
you wish to access. After you enter this information, Pan will contact
the server and download a list of all the groups the server carries and
save it to disk.

Refer to [[#news-servers][News Servers]] for more detailed information.

** Selecting a News Group
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: selecting-a-news-group
:CLASS: title
:END:

The Group Pane contains a list of all the news groups available on the
server. Scroll through the list and enter a group by clicking on its
name.

If this is the first time you have entered this group, you will be
prompted on how many article headers you wish to retrieve from the
server. You can choose to retrieve all article headers available for
that group or limit the retrieval by either quantity of articles or
number of days.

After making a selection from this dialog, Pan will download the article
headers for the selected group and save them locally on the computer.

üìÉ Depending on the news server, certain groups might be "dead" and have no
headers available for download.

After article header retrieval, the group name in the Group Pane will
turn bold, which means there are unread articles in that particular
group. Also the number of unread articles in the group will be displayed
in parenthesis following the group name.

It's not unusual for a server to have tens of thousands of groups, but
usually a user is only interested in a few. To better keep track of the
interesting groups, select the group name by middle-clicking on it and
choose Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Subscribe. Scroll the group window to the top if
necessary and you will see that the selected newsgroup is listed
directly under the Subscribed Groups section.

** Reading Articles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: reading-articles
:CLASS: title
:END:

After entering a group, the header pane will be filled with article
headers. The header pane can be sorted by clicking on the topmost row of
a column, where the column name is located. Clicking again will reverse
the sort. The column that is used for sorting will have a downward arrow
after the column name and the entire column will darken.

Pan defaults to showing collapsed threads. Only the first article of the
thread is shown with a number in parenthesis indicating how many posts
are hidden. Clicking on the right-facing arrow before the header text
will expand the thread, showing the hidden articles in the thread.
Reading the first article of the thread will also expand the thread. The
keyboard shortcut for expanding threads is /Shift + ‚Üí/. /Shift + ‚Üê/ will
collapse the thread.

Clicking on a header will download the article from the server, store it
in the article cache and display it in the article pane. The article is
then marked as read. Read articles are distinguished in the header pane
by using a normal (not bold) font and by showing an open envelope icon
in the state column.

You can scroll the message in the Article Pane by using the scrollbar or
by pressing /Space/. Whenever the bottom of the retrieved article is
already displayed, pressing /Space/ will download the next article.

** Posting Articles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: posting-articles
:CLASS: title
:END:

To post an article in a group and start a new thread, select the group
you wish to post to in the Group Pane and then choose
*Post¬†‚ñ∏ Post to Newsgroup*. If this is the first time you have posted an article to a
newsgroup, the Posting Profile dialog will appear and you will be
required to fill in some information. Next, the Post Article dialog will
appear. Type in a subject and then enter the body of the message at the
bottom. When done, choose *File¬†‚ñ∏ Send Article* to send the article to the
news server and out to the rest of Usenet.

Refer to [[#posting-profiles-dialog][Posting Profiles Dialog]] and [[#post-article-dialog][Post Article Dialog]] for more
detailed information.

** Replying to Articles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: replying-to-articles
:CLASS: title
:END:

If you want to post a reply to a specific article and have your followup
appear in that article's thread, highlight that article in the Header
Pane with the middle mouse button and use *Post¬†‚ñ∏ Followup* to Newsgroup.
The highlighted article's text will appear as quoted text (each line is
preceded by a ">") in the editor window. Type in your response and then
choose *File¬†‚ñ∏ Send Article* to send the article to the news server.

If you want to send a reply to a specific article via email, highlight
that article in the Header Pane with the middle mouse button and choose
*Post¬†‚ñ∏ Reply to Author in Mail* . The highlighted article's text will
appear as quoted text (each line is preceded by a ">") in the editor
window. Type in your response and then choose *File¬†‚ñ∏ Send Article* and
the text will be sent to the default external email application.
Double-check the =To:= field and then send the email as you normally would
with that application.

** Downloading Binaries
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: downloading-binaries
:CLASS: title
:END:

A binary file in Usenet is usually composed of many smaller articles.
Pan automatically organizes all these articles under one special article
header. If all the data that comprises the binary header made it through
the Usenet network successfully, a green, full puzzle-piece is displayed
in the first column. To save the data, select the special header in the
header window and use *Articles¬†‚ñ∏ Save Articles* to download and save the
binary data to disk.

If the binary posts are corrupted by missing or incorrect data, a red,
incomplete puzzle-piece is displayed in the first column. The file may
be saved, but it will probably be corrupt in some way.

üìÉ Supporting binary newsgroups takes a large amount of bandwidth. Unless
you are using a premium news server provider, it is not unusual for many
binary files to be missing or corrupt.

* Groups
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: groups
:CLASS: title
:END:

Working with groups in Pan.

** Group Views
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: group-views
:CLASS: title
:END:

The total number of groups on a news server can be quite extensive. An
easy way to find a specific group is to use the Group text box in the
toolbar. Only groups that match the characters typed in the box will be
displayed in the Group Pane. If you wish to return the Group Pane to its
original state, simply delete the characters in the box by clicking the
X icon to the right of the box.

The group names presented in the Group Pane can be shortened by choosing
*View¬†‚ñ∏ Group Pane¬†‚ñ∏ Abbreviate Names* in Group Pane . This only alters
the way the names are presented in this pane.

** Group Actions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: group-actions
:CLASS: title
:END:

While a news group is selected, you can perform the following actions:

- Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Mark Group Read :: Mark all articles in a group read.
  A typical way to read news is to read all the interesting threads and
  when done mark the group read. The next time you start the news
  reader, choose Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Get New Headers in Selected Group . With
  View¬†‚ñ∏ Header Pane¬†‚ñ∏ Match only Unread Articles , the only headers you
  will see will be the new headers you just downloaded.
- Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Get New Headers in Subscribed Groups :: Grab new headers for
  all the groups in the Subscribed Groups section.
- Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Edit Group Preferences :: Opens the Group Preferences dialog.
  Within this dialog you can customize certain Pan features per group:
  - Character encoding
  - Location in the file hierarchy where attachments are saved
  - The posting profile.
- Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Subscribe :: Add a favorite group to the Subscribed Groups
  section of the Group Pane. Unsubscribe is the opposite of this
  command.
- Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Refresh Group List :: Resync the local group list that Pan
  uses with the current listing on the news server.
- Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Delete Group's Articles :: Delete all the articles for the
  selected group from the article index.

** The Newsrc File
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-newsrc-file
:CLASS: title
:END:

The group list, subscribe/unsubscribe status of each group and the
articles marked read in each group are stored in the newsrc file at
=$HOME/.pan2/newsrc-1=.

The newsrc file format is standard among many Unix newsreaders and can
be used to import and export this information between these
applications.

* Headers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: headers
:CLASS: title
:END:

Users will spend most of their time in Pan interacting with the article
headers in the Header Pane. Pan has many features to optimize header
viewing and article retrieval.

** Header View
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: header-view
:CLASS: title
:END:

Since the total number of all the available article headers in a group
might be enormous, Pan has several options to limit the number of
visible headers to a more manageable number.

In the toolbar, the Subject or Author text box is a filter than can be
used to limit the visible headers. Usually this is used to search for a
specific article or a group of articles. Click on the magnifying glass
icon to choose which header field to base the filter. Only the article
headers that match the characters typed into the text box will be
displayed. Click the X to erase and reset.

- Choose Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Preferences¬†‚ñ∏ Headers :: To hide or change the display
  order of the Header Pane columns.
- Choose View¬†‚ñ∏ Header Pane¬†‚ñ∏ Thread Headers :: To enable or disable
  header threading in the Header Pane.

*** Replies of Matched Articles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: replies-of-matched-articles
:CLASS: title
:END:

The user can pick one of the next three options to control how Pan will
display replies of matched articles.

- In View¬†‚ñ∏ Header Pane :: 
  - Show Matching Articles :: Show only articles that match the
    article view options..
  - Show Matching Articles' Threads ::   Not only show articles that
    match the article view options, but also show all the articles in
    the entire thread of the matched article.  This option will force
    read headers to be visible regardless of the view options.
  - Show Matching Articles Subthreads :: Not only show articles
    that match the article view options, but also show articles that
    are replies of any matched article.

*** Article View Matches
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: article-view-matches
:CLASS: title
:END:

These options control which article headers are displayed in the Header
Pane.

- In View¬†‚ñ∏ Header Pane :: 
  - Match Only Unread Articles :: Only display articles that haven't
    been marked read.
  - Match Only Cached Articles :: Only display articles that are
    available in the local article cache in the computer's hard drive.
  - Match Only Complete Articles :: Only binary articles that are
    complete (full, green puzzle piece in the state column) will be
    displayed. This also hides text articles.
  - Match Only My Articles :: Only articles that the user has posted
    will be displayed.
  - Match Scores of xxxx :: These options deal with scoring where you
    choose to display an article based on its score. Refer to [[#scoring][Scoring]]
    for more information.

** Header Movement
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: header-movement
:CLASS: title
:END:

Movement around the Header Pane can be controlled by several methods,
allowing the user to easily jump around complicated discussion threads
with minimal input. Pan was designed for mouse-less article viewing, so
most people use the keyboard shortcuts associated with these menu
actions. The keyboard shortcut for most menu actions is displayed after
the menu command.

- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Read More :: Scroll the article in the Article Pane. If the
  article is already scrolled to the bottom, grab the next article. You
  can customize the function of this key by changing Preferences¬†‚ñ∏
  Articles¬†‚ñ∏ Space selects next article rather than next unread .
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Read Back :: Scroll the article up in the Article Pane. If it's
  already scrolled to the top, grab the previous article displayed in
  the Thread Pane.
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Next Unread Group :: Skip down to the next subscribed group in
  the Group Pane with unread articles and read the first article.
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Next Group :: Skip down to the next subscribed group in the Group
  Pane and read the first article.
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Next Unread Article :: Read the next unread article in the Thread
  Pane.
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Next Article :: Read the next article, regardless of its
  read/unread state.
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Next Watched Article :: Read the next watched article. A
  watched article is an article with a score of at least 9999. Refer
  to [[#scoring][Scoring]] for more information.
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Previous Article :: Read the previous article in the Thread Pane.
  This doesn't scroll the Article Pane like Go¬†‚ñ∏ Read Back .
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Parent Article :: Read the article for which the currently
  selected article is a reply.
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Next Unread Thread :: Skip to the next unread thread and read the
  first article.
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Next Thread :: Skip to the next thread and read the first article
  in that thread.
- Go¬†‚ñ∏ Previous Thread :: Skip back to the last thread and read the last
  article in that thread.

** Header Selection
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: header-selection
:CLASS: title
:END:

In order to perform an action on an article header, you must select it
first. Use the middle mouse button to select an article. Drag the
selection field with the mouse to select multiple articles. Hold down
the Ctrl key while clicking articles with the middle mouse button to add
individual articles to the selection.

Pan also offers a number of other ways to efficiently select articles.

- Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Select All Articles :: Select all articles in the Header Pane.

  retrieve the article first.

** Header Action
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: header-action
:CLASS: title
:END:

Whenever Pan downloads an article body, the data is saved to disk in the
article cache. The article cache is a fixed-size buffer and when the
cache has been filled, the older articles are erased to make room for
newer ones.

These are the actions you can perform on an article selected in the
Header Pane.

- Articles¬†‚ñ∏ Save Article :: Save the highlighted article to disk. When
  you select this option, the Save Articles dialog will open. From here,
  you can choose:
  - Save Text :: Save the text of the displayed article.
  - Save Attachments :: Save the binary attachments of the selected

:END:

The Body Pane displays the text of a selected article header.

** Digital Images
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: digital-images
:CLASS: title
:END:

Some groups specialize in digital images where each binary post is a
separate image. Pan can automatically decode and display these images.
To display the image, select and view the article header as you normally
would for text and the image will be displayed in the Body Pane.

** Body Views
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: body-views
:CLASS: title
:END:

The way information is presented in the Body Pane can be customized in
several ways.

- In View¬†‚ñ∏ Body Pane :: 
  - Wrap Article Body :: Will force the text to flow into paragraphs
    instead of running off the edge of the text window. This is useful
    to fix badly formatted articles.

  - Show All Headers in Body Pane :: The headers displayed in the
    Header Pane are only a small subset of the all the article
    headers. This commands will display the complete list of article
    headers in the Body Pane before the article text.
  - Rot 13 Selected Text ::  A simple cipher used to hide story
    spoilers, joke punchlines, etc.  Select a block of encrypted text
    and use this option to decode it to clear text.
  - Use Monospace Font ::  Sometimes Usenet authors will create simple
    ASCII artwork or diagrams. By default, Pan uses proportional fonts
    for all text which renders ASCII artwork unreadable. By choosing
    this option, the text of the Body Pane will be displayed using the
    Monospace Font.  You can configure the monospace font in *Edit¬†‚ñ∏
    Preferences¬†‚ñ∏ Font* .
  - Show Smilies as Graphics ::  Change ASCII emoticons like :) into
    graphical versions.
  - Show *Bold*, _Underlined_ and /Italiced/ ::  Over the years, Usenet
    authors have devised several strategies to overcome the limited
    typographic ability of ASCII. Enabling this option will format the
    article text following these typographic hints.
  - Size Pictures to Fit ::  Size digital images so they will display
    in the Body Pane without scrolling. Click on the image to view it
    in its original size.

* Posting

- Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Wrap Text :: Set this option to have text automatically wrap
  when entered.
- Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Check Spelling :: Set this option and possible spelling errors
  in the text area will marked with a red wavy line.
- Edit¬†‚ñ∏ ROT 13 :: ROT13 is a simple cipher to hide story spoilers, joke
  punchlines, etc. Select the text to cipher and use this command.

* Tasks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tasks
:CLASS: title
:END:

Certain tasks performed by Pan, like downloading binary posts or
grabbing new headers for a group, can take a long time. These tasks are
queued and performed in the background while Pan is processing other
tasks like grabbing an article.

** Cancel Last Task
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cancel-last-task
:CLASS: title
:END:

You can quickly cancel the last task added to the task queue by
selecting: *File¬†‚ñ∏ Cancel Last Task* .

** Task Manager
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: task-manager
:CLASS: title
:END:

Background tasks can be manipulated by using the Task Manager. The Task
Manager can be accessed with *File¬†‚ñ∏ Task Manger* or by left-clicking in
the task area of the Status Bar at the bottom of the Pan screen.

The Task Manger window is composed of the following parts:
- Toolbar :: The toolbar contains all the commands you need to
  manipulate the tasks in the Task Manger Window.
- Informational Area :: The Informational Area displays the number of
  queued tasks, the amount of data that needs to downloaded to complete
  the queued tasks, the current download rate and the estimated time
  needed to complete the queued tasks.
- Task List :: A list of queued tasks. Each row is a separate task.

In order to manipulate a task, click on it and the row will be
highlighted. Then click on one of the buttons in the toolbar.

If Pan is shutdown whiles tasks are still waiting in the task manager,
the task list is saved to disk and resumed when Pan is restarted. This,
however, is not true for upload tasks in the current version.

** NZB Files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: nzb-files
:CLASS: title
:END:

Pan saves its task list in =$HOME/.pan2/tasks.nzb= file. You can import
other task lists into Pan by choosing *File¬†‚ñ∏ Import NZB Files* .

* Scoring
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: scoring
:CLASS: title
:END:

Scoring allows the user to give an article a rating based on
user-defined scoring rules. This rating can then be used by Pan to
perform score-based actions.

When a group's article headers are first downloaded from the news
server, all the articles have a score of 0. Then the list of scoring
rules in the score file are applied to each article. The score file
rules might give an article from John Smith a high score, while articles
with a subject line containing the phrase "For Sale" a negative score.

** Scoring Actions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: scoring-actions
:CLASS: title
:END:

Pan can perform two actions based on an article's score:

- View an article by using *View¬†‚ñ∏ Header Pane¬†‚ñ∏ Match Scores of xxxx* .
  The default is to hide articles (by not matching) with a score of
  -9999. and view all other scores.
- Change the background and text color of the score column in the Header
  Pane. This is defined in *Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Preferences¬†‚ñ∏ Colors*.

** Adding Scoring Rules
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: adding-scoring-rules
:CLASS: title
:END:

There are several ways to add rules to the score file. Select an article
in the Header Pane and then select *Articles¬†‚ñ∏ Watch Thread* . This rule
sets the score of any post located in the thread of the selected article
to 9999.

The opposite of the above rule is *Articles¬†‚ñ∏ Ignore Thread*. This rule
sets the score of any post located in the thread of the selected article
to -9999.

Both of these scoring rules only work in the selected group and expire
in one month.

Selecting an article and selecting *Articles¬†‚ñ∏ Ignore Author* will open
the New Scoring Rule dialog.

The default of this scoring rule is to score all the posts of the author
of the selected article -9999 for the next month in the selected group.
By clicking on various fields and selecting different options in the New
Scoring Rule dialog, you can customize the rule further. For instance,
instead of having the rule expire in one month, you can have the rule
last forever. Also note that you can make the rule add to the score of
an article, making it a watch rule. So the name "Ignore Author" can be
somewhat of a misnomer.

When finished, click Add and Rescore to close the dialog box.

Selecting an article and selecting *Articles¬†‚ñ∏ Add a Scoring Rule* is very
similar to the Ignore Author section described above as it opens the
same New Scoring Rule dialog, just with different defaults. Construct a
rule in the same fashion as described above.

** Editing or Deleting Scoring Rules
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: editing-or-deleting-scoring-rules
:CLASS: title
:END:

Selecting an article that is currently being scored and choosing
*Articles¬†‚ñ∏ Edit Article's Watch/Ignore/Score* will open the Article's
Scores dialog box. From this dialog you can manipulate the scoring rule
for the currently selected article. Each rule will have its own row
describing the scoring action (plus or minus points), locations and line
number of this rule in the score file and the texts of the rule. Select
the rule and click Add button to alter the rule or Remove button to
delete the rule from the score file. Click Close and Rescore when
finished.

** Advanced Scoring
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: advanced-scoring
:CLASS: title
:END:

The scoring file is located at =$HOME/.pan2/Scoring=. Advanced users might
want to edit this file directly with a text editor to create advanced
scoring rules that are difficult or impossible to construct from the New
Scoring Rule dialog. The format of the scoring rules is similar to the
application slrn, but be aware that not all slrn scoring functions will
work in Pan.

The slrn scoring functions are described in the document
[[http://www.slrn.org/docs/score.html][slrn - Scoring]].

* Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: customization
:CLASS: title
:END:

This section describes how certain features or actions in Pan can be
customized.

** Behavior
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: behavior
:CLASS: title
:END:

Many of the default actions of Pan, such as mouse clicks, actions when
entering or leaving a group and the action of /Space/ can be altered.

- In Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Preferences¬†‚ñ∏ Behavior :: 
  - Mouse :: The two boxes of the mouse section change the default
    action of the left mouse button. If unselected, you would have to
    double click on a group or article to activate it.
  - Groups :: The selections in the group section control what
    commands Pan will automatically run when manipulating groups.
    - The first box, when activated, will automatically get new headers
      for all subscribed groups whenever Pan is started. This is the
      equivalent of using *Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Get New Headers* in *Subscribed Groups*
      from the menubar.
    - The next box, when activated, will automatically get new headers
      when entering a group. This is the equivalent of using
       *Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Get New Headers* in *Selected Group* from the menubar.
    - The next box, when activated, will mark the entire group read when
      leaving a group. This is the equivalent of using
      *Groups¬†‚ñ∏ Mark Group Read* from the menubar.
    - The last box in the Groups section, when activated, will expand
      all threads in the Header Pane when entering a group.
  - Articles ::
    - The first option, when activated, makes Space select
     the next article rather than the next unread article. This is
     handy if you are viewing a thread with read and unread articles
     mixed together.
    - The next option activates smooth scrolling in the Article Pane.

** GUI Composition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: gui-composition
:CLASS: title
:END:

The layout and view of the Group, Header and Body Panes in Pan can be
customized in several ways.

- Pane Layout :: In *Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Preferences¬†‚ñ∏ Layout* the orientation of the
  Groups, Header and Body Panes can be manipulated.
- Tabbed Layout :: Instead of having all three panes share the Pan main
  window at one time, another view, called Tabbed Layout, can be
  activated by choosing *View¬†‚ñ∏ Layout¬†‚ñ∏ Tabbed Layout*. Now, only one of
  the three Panes will be displayed at a time. Each Pane is brought to
  the front of other Panes by clicking on its tab located directly under
  the tool bar or by pressing "1", "2" or "3" for the Group, Header or
  Body Pane respectively.
- Show/Hide Panes :: You can hide a specific Pane by choosing from
  *View¬†‚ñ∏ Layout* and using the selection box to show/hide each of the
  Panes.
- Fonts :: Choose *Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Preferences¬†‚ñ∏ Fonts* to select a font. Pan can
  use the monospace font in the article Pane, if activated.
- Colors :: Choose *Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Preferences¬†‚ñ∏ Colors* to customize the colors
  used in Pan.  The first section allows you to customize the colors used by scoring
  in the Header Pane. See [[#scoring][Scoring]] for more information on how to use this feature.
  The second section allows you to customize the colors used in the Body
  Pane.

** External Applications
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: external-applications
:CLASS: title
:END:

In this section you set up external applications that Pan can use.

- In Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Preferences¬†‚ñ∏ Applications: :: 
  - Web Browser :: Click the Web Button to choose which external
    application to launch when clicking on an HTML link.
  - Mail Reader :: Choose which external application to launch when
    clicking on an email address or when sending a post via email.

To set up an external text editor, choose *Post¬†‚ñ∏ Post to Newsgroup* .
From the *Post Article* dialog menubar, choose *Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Set Editor*

** Article Cache Size
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: article-cache-size
:CLASS: title
:END:

The article cache is a fixed-size disk buffer where Pan stores articles
when they are downloaded from a news server. If the user downloads a
large amount of binary attachments, the default cache size might be
inadequate.

The article cache size can be changed in *Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Preferences¬†‚ñ∏ Behavior¬†‚ñ∏ Article Cache*

** News Servers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: news-servers
:CLASS: title
:END:

Pan must connect to a special computer called a news server. The news
server is the gateway used to access Usenet.

Choose *Edit¬†‚ñ∏ Edit News Servers* and the Servers dialog will appear.
Click on a server name and you can edit or remove it via the buttons.
Click the Add button to add another server.

When you add or edit an existing server, the Edit a Server's Settings
dialog will appear.

In the location section:

- Address :: The internet address of the server.
- Port :: The port of the server. Port 119 is the standard port number for
  unsecured NNTP connections, port 563 is for TLS/SSL connections.

The next section is the login information for the server. If you server
requires a username and password, enter them here. If the server allows
anonymous login or does not require authentication, just let these
fields blank.

- Username :: Enter the login name if required.
- Password :: Enter the password if required.

The next section allows you to enter certain Pan settings that are
server specific.

- Connection Limit :: Pan can open multiple connections to a server so
  the user can perform simultaneous actions like download a binary
  attachment will reading articles in a text group. In order to follow
  the [[https://gnksa.org/][GNKSA]] rules, the maximum number of connections Pan can have open
  with a server is 4.
- Expire Old Articles :: From this toggle box, you can pick a time
  when Pan will expire old articles and remove them from its article
  index.
- Server Rank :: When you have more than 1 server configured, Pan uses
  server rank to decide from which server to download the
  article. Only after all primary servers have been tried for the
  article will Pan use the fallback servers.  The reason for this
  feature is that a user might have access to a free server and also
  have access to a byte-limited premium server. Server ranking allows
  Pan to use the fallback server as little as possible.
- TLS (SSL) Options :: If security and privacy are of concern, choose
  secured connections if the server supports it. TLS (SSL) support is
  an optional feature and may not be available in your Pan build.
- Always trust this server's certificate :: If you want to trust the
  server regardless of the authenticity of its certificate, you can
  enable this option. Use with caution!
